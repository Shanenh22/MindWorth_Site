      <h2>Our story &amp; values</h2>
      <p>We started MindWorth because we saw too many small businesses struggle to navigate the fast‑evolving world of AI. As a three‑person team, we know what it’s like to wear many hats—and we’re passionate about helping you leverage technology to free up your time, improve quality and grow sustainably. We value transparency, ethical AI and long‑term partnership with our clients.</p>

      <h2>Why choose us?</h2>
      <p>Unlike larger consultancies, we work with a limited number of clients at a time so we can provide personal attention and adapt to your evolving needs. Our vendor‑neutral approach means we recommend the right tools for your budget and goals. And because we’re entrepreneurs ourselves, we understand the constraints and opportunities faced by small businesses.</p>
