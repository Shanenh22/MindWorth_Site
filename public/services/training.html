      <h2>Why train your team?</h2>
      <p>AI adoption is as much about people as it is about technology. Roles that leverage AI are evolving rapidly, and empowering your employees to work alongside intelligent tools is key to unlocking value. Training gives staff the confidence to experiment, saves them hours each week by automating repetitive tasks and helps them contribute to higher‑value projects.</p>

    <section class="container">
      <h2>Our training approach</h2>
      <p>We start by demystifying AI—answering foundational questions and explaining how the technology works in plain language. Through hands‑on exercises, we guide your team to automate high‑volume, low‑creativity tasks using safe, curated tools. Each session includes best practices for data privacy and security, tailored to your industry. No coding experience is required.</p>

      <h2>Training formats &amp; deliverables</h2>
      <p>Choose from in‑person workshops, virtual seminars or self‑paced modules. Participants leave with action plans, step‑by‑step guides and recorded demonstrations. We measure outcomes by tracking time saved, productivity gains and adoption rates to ensure your investment pays off.</p>
