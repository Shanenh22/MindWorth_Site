      <h1>What is custom AI integration consulting?</h1>
      <p>Custom integration aligns the right platforms and algorithms with your workflows. We help you select, configure and embed AI tools so that they deliver value seamlessly—without disrupting your current operations.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="container">
      <h2>Why choose custom integration?</h2>
      <p>Off‑the‑shelf AI solutions often don’t fit unique small‑business processes. By tailoring integrations, we avoid costly misalignment and ensure that AI works within your existing systems. For many clients, the safest and most productive way to use AI is through familiar platforms like Google Workspace, Microsoft&nbsp;365 or industry‑specific suites. Our custom approach ensures you get exactly what you need without unnecessary complexity or vendor lock‑in.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="container">
      <h2>How do we integrate AI into your workflows?</h2>
      <p>We begin with a proof of concept to validate assumptions and confirm that AI delivers the expected value. Next we design APIs and connectors to embed intelligent functions into your CRM, ERP or customer‑service systems. Throughout integration we follow best practices for data governance and change management, layering generative AI on top of existing processes to accelerate ROI and minimise disruption.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="container">
      <h2>Which tools and platforms do we work with?</h2>
      <p>Depending on your needs, we may recommend a combination of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Machine‑learning platforms:</strong> Services like AWS&nbsp;SageMaker or Google Vertex&nbsp;AI that allow you to build, train and deploy models.</li>
        <li><strong>Productivity suites with generative AI:</strong> Tools such as Microsoft&nbsp;365&nbsp;Copilot or Google&nbsp;Workspace with Gemini that help automate content creation and data analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration tools:</strong> Solutions like Cisco&nbsp;Webex&nbsp;AI that summarise meetings and provide intelligent customer‑service agents.</li>
        <li><strong>Conversational AI platforms:</strong> Frameworks like IBM&nbsp;watsonx for building chatbots and data insights.</li>
        <li><strong>Security &amp; observability tools:</strong> Platforms such as Proofpoint and Splunk that use AI to detect threats and monitor system performance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Our agnostic approach ensures you get the right toolset without vendor lock‑in.</p>
