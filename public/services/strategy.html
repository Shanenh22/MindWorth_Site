      <h1>What is an AI strategy &amp; roadmap?</h1>
      <p>An AI strategy &amp; roadmap aligns your business goals with the right technology, people and processes. It sets a clear path from initial discovery to full-scale implementation, ensuring every AI initiative delivers measurable value.</p>

      <h2>Why develop a strategy before adopting AI?</h2>
      <p>Without a plan, AI adoption can be costly and ineffective. Thoughtful planning ensures you invest in the right opportunities and avoid costly missteps. By focusing on high‑impact use cases and integrating AI into existing workflows, our strategic approach maximizes your return on investment and helps you achieve tangible gains in revenue, productivity and customer satisfaction.</p>

      <h2>How do we assess your readiness?</h2>
      <p>Every engagement starts with a detailed discovery. We map your processes, data and pain points to understand where AI can have the greatest impact. Many small‑business employees spend a significant portion of their time on repetitive tasks—our readiness assessment identifies these quick wins. We also evaluate data quality, compliance obligations and cultural readiness to ensure a smooth rollout.</p>

      <h2>What is included in our strategy service?</h2>
      <p>Your customized roadmap includes a business case with projected ROI, phased milestones, tool recommendations and risk‑mitigation strategies. We help you prioritize use cases, design proof‑of‑concept projects and establish change‑management plans for full integration. You’ll leave with a clear plan that outlines resources, timelines and expected outcomes.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="container">
      <h2>How long does it take?</h2>
      <p>The timeline depends on your starting point and goals, but we typically break the journey into manageable phases: a 4–6‑week strategy sprint, a 2–3‑month proof of concept and a phased deployment over six months or longer. Throughout the process, we provide continuous monitoring and course corrections. Many organisations take 12–24&nbsp;months to fully embed AI, but our phased approach ensures you see benefits early.</p>
