      <h1>What does ongoing AI support &amp; mentoring include?</h1>
      <p>AI isn’t a one‑and‑done project. After deployment, models need tuning, users need guidance and regulations evolve. Our support packages provide the expertise and oversight you need to sustain success.</p>

      <h2>Why continuous support matters</h2>
      <p>AI isn’t a one‑and‑done project. Models require tuning, employees need coaching and regulations evolve over time. Talent gaps and governance challenges persist even as systems scale. Ongoing improvement and workforce training are essential to maximize ROI and build trust. Small businesses also face compliance obligations such as GDPR, CCPA and, for healthcare, HIPAA; failing to update models and processes can be costly.</p>

      <p>We align key performance indicators with your goals—whether it’s freed time, revenue growth or customer satisfaction—and adjust our support accordingly.

We also monitor adoption rates and feedback to ensure the technology is meeting real needs.</p>
